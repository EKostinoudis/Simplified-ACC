function SNR = demoAAC1(fNameIn, fNameOut)
%DEMOAAC1 Tests the Level 1 encoding.
% Arguments:
% - fNameIn: The name of a ".wav" file that is to be encoded. The file must
%            contain 2-channel sound with 48kHz sampling frequency.
% - fNameOut: The name of a ".wav" file that will be produced. The file
%             will contain 2 sound channels with 48kHz sampling frequency.
% Returns:
% - SNR: Signal to noise ratio (in db) of the two channels after the
%        encoding-decoding of Level 1. (2x1 table)
